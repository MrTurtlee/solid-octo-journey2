# Choose a mathmatical equation / formular and code it so that it gives a
#result

# for eg:
    # You can choose a pythagoras theorem, which gets 2 numbers from
    # the user and print out the result

# If you  make your own equation, make 3 of them
# for eg: y = x^2 + 30

# if you are using square root, you can use 'import maths',
# and google how to use sqrt
