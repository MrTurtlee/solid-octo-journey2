# make a program which if your number is divisible by 11


# 1) getting the input and converting it to an int

# 2) do some if conditions to check if it is devisible
#       - use % to help check
#           example: 10 % 3 == 0
#           because 10 / 2 == 5 with no remainder
#               so % gives 0 (the remainder)

# 3) print a final comment on whether the number is divisible or not
