# Task:
# make a variable called word 
# and give it this string: "Hello World"

# using a for loop, print every character in the string
# with a new line in between

# tip: strings are technically lists in coding.
# for eg: word = "apple"
#           word[1] == "p"


word = "hello world"

for letter in word:
    print (letter)
